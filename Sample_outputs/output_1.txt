Ask a Question : where is dictionaries taught?



RESPONSE
Greetings! To find the information about Dictionaries in Python, I recommend watching Video number 5, titled "Dictionaries in python". In this video, the concept of Dictionaries is introduced at around 17 seconds to 233 seconds. Here, you will learn about what a dictionary is, how to access its items, and some other basic concepts.
Additionally, Video number 6, titled "Dictinoaries method", covers more in-depth topics about Dictionaries and their methods from around 0 to 14 seconds and 388 to 395 seconds. In this video, you will learn about various methods of dictionaries and how they can be used in real-world programming problems.
Remember, the videos are part of a series about the basics of Python, so you might find other useful information as well while watching these videos.
I hope this helps! If you have any other questions related to the course, feel free to ask
