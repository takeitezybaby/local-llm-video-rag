QUERY
Ask a Question : is nlp taught in this course?




RESPONSE
Greetings! In the course you're referring to, NLP (Natural Language Processing) is not explicitly mentioned as a topic. However, Python has several libraries for handling text data and performing basic NLP tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and simple sentiment analysis.
Here are some videos that might be related to your question:
1. Title: Libraries in Python (Video number: 4) - In this video, you'll learn about various libraries available in Python, including some like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and TextBlob which can be used for NLP tasks.
2. Title: Regular Expressions (Video number: 3) - While not an NLP library per se, understanding regular expressions is essential for working with text data in Python.
As for your question, a comprehensive course on NLP using Python would likely delve deeper into topics like part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and machine translation. If you're interested in such a course, I recommend looking up specific resources dedicated to Python and NLP.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions about the basics of Python.
