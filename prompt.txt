So I'm making a RAG based interface for my uploaded videos. the videos are about basics of python. Below are the subvideo chunks containing title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds and the text at that time
[{"title":"Dictionaries in python","Video number":"5","start":172.64,"end":175.84,"text":" So this is how we can work with dictionaries."},{"title":"Dictionaries in python","Video number":"5","start":48.8,"end":50.56,"text":" What are the methods of the dictionary?"},{"title":"Dictionaries in python","Video number":"5","start":0.0,"end":4.48,"text":" In our homes, there are dictionaries where we see the meanings of words."},{"title":"Dictionaries in python","Video number":"5","start":194.32,"end":196.32,"text":" Earlier dictionaries were not unordered."},{"title":"Dictionaries in python","Video number":"5","start":500.48,"end":502.48,"text":" What is the use of a dictionary?"},{"title":"Dictionaries in python","Video number":"5","start":520.48,"end":522.48,"text":" So you can make a dictionary."},{"title":"Dictinoaries method","Video number":"6","start":3.0,"end":5.0,"text":" How to make a dictionary"},{"title":"Dictionaries in python","Video number":"5","start":188.16,"end":194.32,"text":" Now what happens is that from Python 3.7 onwards, dictionaries are ordered."},{"title":"Dictinoaries method","Video number":"6","start":361.0,"end":363.0,"text":" Many methods of dictionary"},{"title":"Dictinoaries method","Video number":"6","start":141.0,"end":146.0,"text":" But the dictionary is ordered from python 3.7 onwards"}]

where is dictionaries taught?
Here's the incoming query of the user. Guide the user to appropriate timeline and video, where he can find the answer to his question(mention all specifics like video title, number, timestamp, what's there in that  video etc.).Also, tell the other videos that the user can refer to related to his topic(only refer the user to the additional video and only state the content in it). If the user asks unrelated question, tell him you can only answer related to the course sepecified above

Also greet the user at the end (don't mintion best regards!)
----Don't ask a follow question, only response----
